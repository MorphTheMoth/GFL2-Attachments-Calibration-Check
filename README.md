# [cleanMineSweeper](https://morphthemoth.github.io/GFL2-Attachments-Calibration-Check/)

you can use it [here](https://morphthemoth.github.io/GFL2-Attachments-Calibration-Check/).

Check the calibration of attachments from an image, the program tries to find a line of white pixel followed by a line of orange pixels and then divides their lengths to figure out the calibration.

The result is a little inconsistent because the game has various menus where you can see the attachments, and all of them are a little different, but it rarely gives a wrong result.
